What is MySQL?
Relational Database: MySQL organizes data into tables with rows and columns, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Open Source: MySQL is freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL), though commercial licenses are also available.

Cross-Platform: It runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and more.

Client-Server Architecture: MySQL operates on a client-server model, where the database server handles requests from clients (applications or users).

Key Features of MySQL:
High Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency, even with large datasets.

Scalability: Handles small to large-scale applications.

Security: Offers robust data security features, including encryption and user access control.

ACID Compliance: Ensures data integrity with support for transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Replication and High Availability: Supports master-slave replication and clustering for fault tolerance.

Storage Engines: Supports multiple storage engines like InnoDB (default), MyISAM, MEMORY, and more.

Compatibility: Works with many programming languages (e.g., Python, PHP, Java) and frameworks
